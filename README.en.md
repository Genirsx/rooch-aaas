# Project Name  
**OneCommand: A Cross-Platform Natural Language Agent to Control Wallets and Social Platforms with Ease**

---

# Project Overview  
**OneCommand is a natural language-driven intelligent agent system that integrates Web3 wallet operations and Web2 social controls. With a single sentence, users can complete cross-platform tasks such as batch transfers, following, posting, and identity binding.**

It is designed to enable ‚Äúthe next generation of Web3 interaction,‚Äù freeing users from repetitive tasks and letting them control wallets and social platforms as naturally as chatting.

---

# Background & Problem Statement  
As Web3 activities increasingly span across platforms like Telegram, X (Twitter), and Discord, users face fragmented operations, intensive repetitive tasks, and error-prone tools with high technical barriers.

**Key pain points include:**

- Wallets and social platforms are disconnected, requiring frequent switching  
- Routine tasks (posting, liking, binding accounts) are tedious  
- Automation tools are too complex for regular users  
- Mistakes in social or asset-related operations can be costly  

---

# Core Functional Modules

### 1. Intelligent Command Parsing
- Understands natural language commands and context using LLM + prompt engineering  
- Supports fuzzy matching and semantic reasoning  

### 2. Multi-Wallet Operations
- Connects to major wallets like MetaMask, Rabby, WalletConnect  
- Supports batch transfers, signing, authorizations, airdrop claiming  

### 3. Web2 Social Control
- Controls Telegram, X, and more for posting, liking, following, messaging  
- Allows task scripting and one-click reuse  

### 4. Chained Action Logic
- Supports event-driven automated responses  
- Example: `IF someone mentions my X account AND they hold a specific NFT THEN like + DM`

# Integration with the AaaS Framework

- Acts as a persistent Agent to continuously monitor user input/events and respond  
- Supports local or cloud deployment with APIs for DApp integration  
- Integrates with DID and on-chain identity to form a unified "AI Identity Agent"  
- Enables cross-platform interactions between on-chain behavior and Web2 social actions

# New Capabilities: **Project Analysis + Autonomous Interaction Module**

OneCommand is not just an executor‚Äîit's also a **"Web3 Smart Analyst"**:

1. Automatically visits project websites and task pages  
2. Identifies task requirements (e.g. minting, sharing, wallet binding)  
3. Evaluates interaction value (airdrop likelihood, hype level, risk)  
4. Notifies the user whether it's worth engaging‚Äîand can auto-complete the tasks  

**Tech Stack:**

- Browser Automation: Puppeteer / Playwright  
- Natural Language Page Analysis: LangChain + GPT  
- Wallet Operations: Ethers.js + wallet plugins  
- Data Evaluation: GraphQL APIs + Dune / DeBank  

**Example Command:**

> ‚ÄúCheck if there are any new tasks on the Blast website. If yes, mint and make a post.‚Äù

# Application Scenarios

- **Web3 Community Managers**: Mass messaging, identity binding, task monitoring  
- **Project Teams**: Campaign launches, interaction tracking, data collection  
- **KOLs / Content Creators**: Automated interactions and account linking  
- **Airdrop Hunters**: Batch operations, identity binding, efficient participation  
- **Everyday Users**: Natural language access to the full Web3 experience

# Potential Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                   | Mitigation Strategy                                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multi-platform restrictions / API changes | Browser injection + user-supplied API keys         |
| Risk in wallet operations  | Interaction confirmation + risk control model + limits       |
| Ambiguity in command parsing | Context-aware semantic analysis + multi-turn clarification  |
| User privacy concerns       | Local execution mode + encrypted storage with no uploads     |

# Future Vision

- Integrate more platforms (e.g. Discord, Farcaster, Lens, etc.)  
- Launch "Autonomous Agent" mode for scheduled task execution  
- Combine on-chain and social data analytics for task scoring and recommendations  
- Build "multi-agent collaboration" to automate DAO management, proposals, voting, and more

# Conclusion

**OneCommand is a true AI Operations Agent (AaaS)** ‚Äî it not only understands your language, but acts on it.

It transforms Web3 participation from a complex technical process into a natural, intuitive conversation.  
Whether you're a builder, a creator, or an everyday user, OneCommand is your intelligent assistant in the Web3 world‚Äîpioneering the future of AaaS-driven interaction.
